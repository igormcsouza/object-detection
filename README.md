## How to get the data

I used the data from a Google Competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-ai-open-images-object-detection-track/data). Just click there and you will be redirect to the competition page with the dataset available. This data is very large, is about 9GB of image, so, be prepared.
